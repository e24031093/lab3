# lab3
Problem A:
To compile the function,you should key in:
"g++ -o main main.cpp"
To execute the function,you should key in:
"./main"

Problem B:
size	sort 		insertion_sort
1000	0.000234	0.020332
10000	0.00267		1.05893
100000	0.038282	108.331

because sort O(nlogn)
for three kinds of size, its executing time is proportional to
3000,40000,500000

and insertion_sort O(n^2)
for three kinds of size, its executing time is proportional to
10^6 10^8 10^10

so, insertion_sort growth rate is more quick.
